# Development of Education App Presence Monitoring with Geolocator Environment Management

Welcome to a modern approach to educational presence monitoring! This repository brings together robust technologies to deliver a comprehensive solution for attendance tracking and academic engagement.

Our system is architected with Golang serving as a reliable API bridge, connecting an intuitive administrative interface built in React.js to a seamless user experience designed in Flutter. By harnessing Flutterâ€™s advanced geolocation capabilities, the app enables precise student attendance verification via latitude and longitude coordinates.

Beyond attendance, the platform offers a rich set of features including:
- **Roster Management:** Efficiently organize and monitor class participants.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Facilitate real-time engagement between educators and students.
- **Comprehensive Administration:** Administrative tools for oversight and management of academic environments.
