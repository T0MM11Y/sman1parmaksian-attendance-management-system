# Education App Presence Monitoring with Geolocator Environment Management

Welcome to a next-generation solution for educational presence and engagement!

This project seamlessly combines the strengths of three modern technologies: Golang as a robust API layer, React.js for a powerful and intuitive admin dashboard, and Flutter for a smooth, cross-platform student experience. By leveraging Flutter’s advanced geolocation features, the app enables precise student attendance tracking—ensuring that presence is verified with latitude and longitude coordinates, directly from the mobile device.

But that’s just the beginning. The platform goes beyond basic attendance:
- **Dynamic Roster Management:** Effortlessly organize and oversee class rosters in real-time.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Foster classroom engagement with built-in Q&A features for live interaction.
- **Comprehensive Admin Tools:** Manage, monitor, and gain insights into student activity with an easy-to-use interface.

Take a closer look at the app in action:
